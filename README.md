## Introduction to Angular

- Overview of Angular framework
- Key concepts and features

- # Angular Development Environment Setup and Sample Project

## Introduction to Angular

Angular is a powerful open-source front-end web application framework developed by Google. This guide will help you set up the Angular development environment and provide a sample project to get you started.

### Key Concepts and Features
- **Components:** Building blocks of Angular applications.
- **Modules:** Organizational units that group related components and services.
- **Services:** Reusable application logic, often used for data retrieval and sharing information between components.
- **Data Binding:** Mechanism to synchronize data between the model and view.

## Setting up the Development Environment

### 1. Installing Node.js and npm

Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js.

### 2. Installing Angular CLI

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Angular CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
